#Chapter 7: Migration Flows [Kaplan et al., red book]
 As people move either in or out of an area, that area's *population* changes. More importantly, migration *can change the composition of an area* because migrants are *not evenly divided* among all ages and ethnicities.
 
##Facts
 * About *175 million* people live outside their country of birth today
 * *5-10 million* people migrate from one country to another *each year*
 * Most people move from developing countries to other developing countries
 * *Reasons to move*<br>
>	Most people: Discover economic oppertunities<br>
	Few people: Flee from warfare & violence<br>
 * *A small number of migrants move from*<br>
>	1 one industrialized to another<br>
   	2 developing world to developed, only accounts for a small number of international migration.<br>
 * *Active devlpg-devlpd migration routes*
>	1 Latin America -> United States/Canada<br>
	2 Asia -> United States/Canada<br>
	3 North Africa -> Europe<br>
 * *Intercountry* migration *less* important in developed world 'compared to' *Migration within country*
 * *Migration within country examples*
 >	1 rural-urban migration (5b)(US)
 * Over *78%* Americans live in urban areas
 * Only *44%* populations in developing countries live in urban areas
 * Migration is not always long-distance and permanent: some migrants are only practicing cyclical movements
 * Micration is often *involuntary*, refugees from Sudan are forced to migrate because of war
 * *Dearborn, Michigan* is *1/3 Arab*.
 * In history of United States, there are nearly *40 millions of FREE MIGRANTS*
 * Used to be source: Europe
 * Now is the source: Latin America + Asia
 * *Emergency Quota Act* of 1921 is the *first law* to limit migration
 * This restricted migrants from any country to *3% of that country living in US by 1910*
 * *Slavery* is a *forced migration*
 * *20 Million* of Afticans to plantations as workers in N/S Americas
 * Slave trade btw *Arabian Peninsula* and *East Africa*, *18 million* Africans 7th-19th

 *Migrant Workers*

 * Over *11 milion* people are from other countries (Mostly south, southeast Asian) in the Gulf States of Middle East
 > E.g. India, Bangladesh, Philippines
 * Endure horrible living conditions, abuse, great cultural differences.
 * The money they send back home are called *remittances*
 * Induce social challenges (violence, attacks etc) because *host country poorly prepared for cultural effects*
 * E.g. attacks on Turks in Europe (Germany, Austria, Belgium)
 * Fear of Muslim groups -> Right win oppose immigration laws
 * Flanders reagion of Belgium: Vlaams Belang party, 10%-increase->nearly30% (late 1990s, anti-immigrants)
 * Support for Jewish (whom experienced anti-semitism) when Muslim population increased

##5A Migration vs. Movement

**Migration**
 1. Permanent relocation
 2. Of one's place of residence
 3. Generally considered to be long-distance move
<br>

 *Two types of migration*
 
 
 | International migration | Internal migration                                  |
 |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 | Country A -> Country B  | ProvinceA(Within Country)->ProvinceB(Within Country)|


**Cyclical movements/migration**
 1. Occurs when people move back and forth between two/multiple locations
 2. Occurs when a migrant *leaves his or her home and lives or works for a period of time* in another location and *then returns home* or to the starting location.
 3. Small scale: People commuting to work, then back home
 4. Can also be *seasonal*
 5. E.g. People in the north (retired) move to florida for winter
 <br>Movement results in significant economic consequences.<br>
 Cylindrical movements are also common for pastoral nomads, farmers who move with their animals in seasons.
 <br>Seasonal agricultural workers are also cyclical migrants. (Following planting/harvesting seasons each yr)<br>
 * Example: Southern workers move north when weather turns warm, and returns during the winter
 
**Periodic movement**
 1. Population movement over *long distances*
 2. Occurs from time to time
 3. *Not permanent*
 4. Similar to cylindrical movement, *length of time* from home is *greater*
 5. E.g. Go to college, join military
 6. Another E.g.: Guest workers, entering for a *specific period of time*
 
##5B Types of Migration
**Primitive migration**
 1. Most *basic* form of migration
 2. Occurs when human population *run out of food*
 3. Especially common among *hunters and gatherers*
 4. Environmental change + natural disaster

**Mass migration**
 1. Migration *before the modern era*
 2. Also known as *group migration*
 3. Large group of people moving together
 4. Can be community, tribe/ethnic group, or even army
 5. E.g. Colonization, British settlement in North America

**Free migration**
 1. Decision to relocate permanently to another location
 2. Without coercion, support, or compulsion of any government or group in power.
 3. People decide to migrate without being forced
 
**Restricted migration**
 1. Migration is no longer "free" for migrants because of the complex set of rules the destination country apply
 2. *Emergency Quota Act, 1921* : First law to *limit migration*
 3. This restricted migrants from any country to *3% of that country living in US by 1910*
 4. Act forever changed the way immigration is handled

**Impelled migration**
 1. Pressured by a governmental agency to move
 2. Migrants have *some choices* to do so, but are *pressurized*
 3. E.g. Migration of Jews from Germany under Nazi rule in 1930s

**Forced migration**
 1. Migration forced by governments
 2. Migrants have *no right to choose*, and are *seriously pressurized*
 3. E.g. Early 1940s/late 1930s, Nazi began forcing Jews to leave/to be moved into certain settlements
 4. Slavery is large-scale forced migration
 5. Slave trade: *16-19th century*
 6. *20 Million* of Afticans to plantations as workers in N/S Americas
 7. Trail of Tears, *Native Americans Georgia-Oklahoma*, 1838-39
 8. Relocation of *Japanese Americans into internment camps*, 1940s
 9. Slave trade btw *Arabian Peninsula* and *East Africa*, *18 million* Africans 7th-19th
 10. Forced internal migration also occurs around the world
 
**Rural-to-urban migration**
 1. Countries w. low industrialization: 24%-40% urban population
 2. Industrialized countries: over 75% urban population
 3. Internal immigration: rural area->urban city
 4. Food, shelter, social services, employment changes a country
 5. Fewer farmers to supply resources
 6. E.g. China is expected to see hundreds of millions of this immigration

***Measuring immigration***
 *Gross migration*: Total number of people who leave and enter a country<br>
 *Net migration*: Difference between the number of people who leave and the number of new arrivals (Can be negative if more leave than arrive)<br>
 *Out-migration*: Total number of people leaving the country
 *In-migration*: Total number of people entering the country
 
 ***World migrations***
  1. *16-19th* centuries, *9-12 millioon Africans* are enslaved in America (actual number higher because some died in passage)
  2. *1830s*, *50,000* Native Americans forced out in south US, *resettle in Oklahoma*. Called *Trail of Tears*
  3. *1923 Treaty of Lausanne* (Turkey and Greece) Forced movement of *2 million people*. Muslim Greeks -> Turkey, Greeks in Turkey -> Greece
  4. Nazis in Germany *1933*, to *1939*, *half a million* Jews forced to flee from Germany + Austria
  5. *1947 Partition of British India* -> India+Pakistan
  6. Hindus: Pakistan -> India
  7. Muslims, India -> Pakistan
  8. Sikhs, Jains, and other religions were also affected
  9. *12 million* people were displaced and *500,000* and more perished in the migrations
  10. *1948 Palestine v. Israel war*, *600,000* migration of Palestinian Arabs
  11. Pol Pot, evacuation of city population, *3 million* Cambodians to move, *2 million people* died
  12. *3 Gorgeous Dam, 1990-2000*, relocation for over 1.24 million people, also moving people along Yangtze river before 2020
  13. Between *late 1700s to late 1800s*, *161,000 convicts* reliocated to Australia
