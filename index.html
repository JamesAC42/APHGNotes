<ul>
<li>
<strong>Migration</strong>
*<em>Permanent</em> relocation of ones place of residence and generally considered to be a long distance move
*Implies a degree of permanency
*Temporary movements such as vacation are <em>not</em> considered migration
*Moving is not necessarily migration
*<strong>International migration</strong>
    *Moving permanently from one country to another
*<strong>Internal migration</strong>
    * Occurs <em>within</em> a country
    * Easy to see a large amount of people move from one area to another area, similarly

<ul>
<li>Trends where large amounts of people move from place to place</li>
<li><em>Movement is not permanent, migration is permanent</em></li>
<li>
<strong>Cyclical movements</strong>

<ul>
<li>When people move back and forth between two places or among a few locations </li>
<li>On a small scale, happens daily in work / school commutes</li>
<li>Season commutes mass

<ul>
<li>Retirees move to warmer places in winter, and head north when spring arrives</li>
<li>Farmers who move based on water and vegetables</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Periodic movement</strong>

<ul>
<li>Population moves often over long distances that occur from time to time but are not permanent</li>
<li><em>Semi-permanent</em></li>
<li>Similar to cyclical, length away from home is longer</li>
<li>
<em>Long distances,</em> long period of time</li>
<li>Can include moving for college, or as a laborer

<ul>
<li>Laborers move to where work is </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guest workers allowed to enter a country for a specified period of time to work in certain industries

<ul>
<li>Economy where they live is not as well established</li>
<li>Plan to live in working country for certain amount of time</li>
<li>
<strong>Remittances</strong>

<ul>
<li>Payments guest workers send back to their families/ home country</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of immigrants

<ul>
<li>Sometimes countries are poorly prepared to accept large amounts of working immigrants even though they need laborers</li>
<li>
<em>Turks</em> have been attacked in <em>Europe, Germany, Austria, and Belgium</em>

<ul>
<li>Fear of Muslim immigrants bringing extremists relatives</li>
<li>Fuels racism and anti-immigration from right wing politicians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Terrorist attacks in the name of Islam

<ul>
<li>Increased support for anti-Islam in countries such as <em>France, Germany, Belgium</em>
</li>
<li><em>Opposition to immigration</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guest workers are needed economically, but governments <em>need to prepare for social consequences</em>
    * Could make sure that schools are integrated and expose people to different cultures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
