<ul>
<li>Migration
*Permanent relocation of ones place of residence and generally considered to be a long distance move
*Implies a degree of permanency
*Temporary movements such as vacation are not considered migration
*Moving is not necessarily migration
*International migration
    *Moving permanently from one country to another
*Internal migration
    *Occurs within a country
    *Easy to see a large amount of people move from one area to another area, similarly

<ul>
<li>Trends where large amounts of people move from place to place</li>
<li>Movement is not permanent, migration is permanent</li>
<li>Cyclical movements

<ul>
<li>When people move back and forth between two places or among a few locations </li>
<li>On a small scale, happens daily in work / school commutes</li>
<li>Season commutes mass

<ul>
<li>Retirees move to warmer places in winter, and head north when spring arrives</li>
<li>Farmers who move based on water and vegetables</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Periodic movement

<ul>
<li>Population moves often over long distances that occur from time to time but are not permanent</li>
<li>Semi-permanent</li>
<li>Similar to cyclical, length away from home is longer</li>
<li>Long distances, long period of time</li>
<li>Can include moving for college, or as a laborer

<ul>
<li>Laborers move to where work is </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guest workers allowed to enter a country for a specified period of time to work in certain industries

<ul>
<li>Economy where they live is not as well established</li>
<li>Plan to live in working country for certain amount of time</li>
<li>Remittances

<ul>
<li>Payments guest workers send back to their families/ home country</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of immigrants

<ul>
<li>Sometimes countries are poorly prepared to accept large amounts of working immigrants even though they need laborers</li>
<li>Turks have been attacked in Europe, Germany, Austria, and Belgium

<ul>
<li>Fear of Muslim immigrants bringing extremists relatives</li>
<li>Fuels racism and anti-immigration from right wing politicians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Terrorist attacks in the name of Islam

<ul>
<li>Increased support for anti-Islam in countries such as France, Germany, Belgium</li>
<li>Opposition to immigration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guest workers are needed economically, but governments need to prepare for social consequences
    *Could make sure that schools are integrated and expose people to different cultures</li>
</ul>
